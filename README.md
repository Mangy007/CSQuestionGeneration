## CSQuestionGeneration

# drivercode.py
a driver code which is a common code for every question and drives the flow of the entire module;

# randomization_of_options.py
For genarating random options from the given set of distractors

# Arithmetic_operations_and_their_distractors
This is module1 of the project by whuch arithmetic operations like binary addition/subtraction/multiplication questions and their respective distractors can be generated.

# Functions and their description used in the arithmetic question generation module are as follows:

Rand_key - For generating random binary strings

findTwoscomplement - gives two’s complement of the string we input

Xor - Performs xor operation on two strings

Flip - flips two random digits in the string we give as input

Add - adds two strings

Addop1 - distractor that returns two’s complement of the result of addition operation

Sub - performs subtraction

Subop1 - generates distractors for subtraction 

Multp - performs multiplication operation

Opts - shuffles options everytime it is run randomly

decimalToBinary - converts decimal to binary strings

decimalToOctal - converts decimal to octal strings

decimalToBinary - converts decimal to binary strings

binaryToDecimal - converts binary to decimal strings

binaryToOctal - converts binary to octal strings

binaryToHexadecimal - converts binary to hexadecimal strings

octalToDecimal - converts octal to decimal strings

octalToBinary - converts octal to binary strings

octalToHexadecimal - converts octal to hexadecimal strings

hexadecimalToDecimal - converts hexadecimal to decimal strings

hexadecimalTobinary - converts hexadecimal to binary strings

hexadecimalToOctal - converts hexadecimal to octal strings
